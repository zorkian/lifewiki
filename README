Welcome to LifeWiki.

Eventually this document will contain a bit about the software, but maybe
that's irrelevant if it's never going to have public source release.

If you're setting this up somewhere, the incantations that you should know
to get your httpd.conf setup correctly are:

# Basic setup that is used first, with clarifications below
PerlModule HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
PerlSetEnv LIFEWIKIHOME /home/xb95/lifewiki
PerlRequire /home/xb95/lifewiki/mason_handler.pl

# Handle files in the root
<Location />
    DefaultType text/html
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler LifeWiki::HTML
</Location>

# Serve regular files outside of the scope of Mason
<LocationMatch "\.(css|js|png|jpg|jpeg|gif)">
    SetHandler default-handler
</LocationMatch>

# DO NOT serve files with a .m extension and do not serve the
# autohandlers and dhandlers that we have setup
<LocationMatch "(\.m|dhandler|autohandler)$">
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlInitHandler Apache::Constants::NOT_FOUND
</LocationMatch>
