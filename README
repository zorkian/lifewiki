Welcome to LifeWiki.

Eventually this document will contain a bit about the software, but maybe
that's irrelevant if it's never going to have public source release.

If you're setting this up somewhere, the incantations that you should know
to get your httpd.conf setup correctly are:

---------------------------------------------------------------
# Basic setup that is used first, with clarifications below
PerlModule HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler
PerlSetEnv LIFEWIKIHOME /home/xb95/lifewiki
PerlRequire /home/xb95/lifewiki/mason_handler.pl
---------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously you'll have to setup other stuff (User, Port, Group, start
servers, logging, etc) to suit your needs.  You'll also want to look at the
etc/config.pl.example and then copy that to etc/config.pl and set it up
appropriately.
